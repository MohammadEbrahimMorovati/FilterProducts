Here’s a professional and well-structured `README.md` for your **Product Filter Web App** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

---

# 🛍️ Product Filter Web App

A responsive, interactive web application that allows users to **search and filter products** by categories in real-time. Built using vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and modern **CSS**, this project simulates an e-commerce interface with dynamic filtering and search functionality.

## 🔍 Features

* 🔎 **Live Search** — Filter products by typing keywords.
* 🗂️ **Category Filters** — Filter products by predefined tags (e.g., Watch, Shirt, Jewelry).
* 📦 **Dynamic Product Rendering** — Products are fetched from a local JSON server and displayed on load.
* 💅 **Modern UI** — Clean, responsive, and minimal interface design.
* ⚡ **Fast Performance** — Built without any heavy frameworks, ensuring lightweight and snappy interactions.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
.
├── filterProduct.HTML        # Main HTML structure
├── filterProduct.css         # Styling with variables, grid, and transitions
├── filterProduct.js          # JavaScript logic for search, filter, and rendering
└── db.json                   # (Optional) Mock database served with JSON Server
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-filter-app.git
cd product-filter-app
```

### 2. Start Local JSON Server

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **JSON Server** installed:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Then run:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

Make sure your `db.json` is in this format:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Elegant Watch",
      "price": "$199",
      "image": "https://example.com/watch.jpg",
      "category": "Watch"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 3. Open the App

Just open `filterProduct.HTML` in your browser. The app will automatically fetch data from `http://localhost:3000/items`.

> 💡 Ensure CORS is not blocked or use a browser extension like [Allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/).

## 🎨 Styling

The UI is styled using modern CSS features such as:

* CSS Grid Layout
* CSS Variables (e.g., `--primaryColor`)
* Responsive design and transitions
* Google Fonts (`Lato`)

## 🧠 How It Works

* When the DOM loads, `filterProduct.js` fetches data via Axios from the mock backend.
* The user can:

  * **Type in the search bar** to filter products by title.
  * **Click category buttons** to filter by tag.
* Filtering is dynamic and instant without reloading the page.

## 📸 Screenshots

> *(Optional: Include screenshots or GIFs of the working interface here)*

## 📦 Dependencies

* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) — HTTP client
* [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) — Mock REST API

## 🛠️ Customization

You can easily customize:

* Categories in the HTML
* Product data in `db.json`
* Styles and theme colors in `filterProduct.css`

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Add pagination or lazy loading
* ✅ Support multiple filter criteria (e.g., price range, brand)
* ✅ Add sorting (low to high, etc.)
* ✅ Convert to React or Vue for better scalability
